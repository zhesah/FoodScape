# FoodScape
Berkeley Food Institute Project in Spring 2017. 

The interactive map aims to show the power structure of the university through the lens of food and agriculture, from upper level administration to student groups on campus. Each bubble represents a different type of campus entity, such as teaching departments, research institutions, student services, etc.

Developed using D3.js
